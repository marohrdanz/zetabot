# ZetaBot

This is chatbot is the result of following
[Anthropic's customer support chatbot tutorial](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/use-case-guides/customer-support-chat)
and modifying it slightly to be a very basic statistics chatbot.

The only goal here was for me to understand the API and how to write basic
tools for it.

## Quickstart

1. Create python virtual environment with `python3 -m venv venv`
2. Activate the virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the steamlit app with `streamlit run app.py`
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`

Note: An Anthropic API key is required to run this chatbot.
